------ Basic fundamentals - loops, conditional statements assignments - 

1. Program to print a table of any number.
2. Program to reverse a given number
3. Program to check whether number is prime or not

4.Calculate sum of first 20 integers. ( input -> 20, output -> total sum of 1 to 20 numbers )
5.Print all prime numbers between two given numbers.
 

------- OOPS Assignment:


 1. 
 Create a class Math with following requirements
- A class level data member called PI set to 3.14.
- A class level public method called getCircleArea, which takes as input an integer parameter called radius. This function should return area of the circle as a double

2. 
Create a class Student with following requirements

Two data members
age : int
name : String
Four constructors
Default constructor : Should set age to 0 and name to null
Constructor with int parameter : Should set age to the passed parameter and name to null
Constructor with String parameter : Should set name to the passed parameter and age to 0
Constructor with two parameters - int and String : Should set the age to int parameter and name to String parameter
The assignment code should only be in the 4th constructor. The top 3 constructors should use telescoping to invoke the 4th constructor.

3. 

Create a Node class with following requirements

Two data members
i. data : int
ii. next : Node
A constructor which takes an integer parameter. This constructor should set data property and leave the next set to null.
A constructor which takes a Node parameter. This constructor should make a deep copy of the passed node


4. 

Create a set of classes to meet the following requirements:

a. Class Point
It should have 2 data-members: x and y.
Add a constructor with two parameters: x and y.
Add a copy constructor.
b. Class Rectangle
It should have 2 data-members:

	topLeft (Point)
	bottomRight (Point)

Add a constructor with 4 parameters of type int: topLeftX, topLeftY, bottomRightX, bottomRightY.

Add a constructor with 2 parameters of type Point: topLeft, bottomRight.

Add a constructor with 1 parameter of type Rectangle.

Make sure that Rectangle constructors make deep copies.


5. Create Student class with age and name. Create 2 objects with dynamic input values.
	Write a static swap function which takes 2 student object parameters and swap the values between object attributes and then display output with swapped value.

6. 

Create a class to calculate Area of circle with one data member to store the radius.
	a. constructor - Initialize radius from user
	b. calculateArea - to calculate area
	3. display- to display area

7. Create a class Employee with(empNo ,salary and totalSalary) with following features.
 a.Only parameterized constructor;
 b.totalSalary always represent total of all the salaries of all employees created
 c.empNo should be auto incremented.
 d.Write dispaly method to display each employee details along with total salary of all employees.
 

 8.Create class Product (pid, price, quantity) with parameterized constructor.
 Create a main function in different class (say ProductClient) and perform following task:
 a.Accept five product information from user and store in an array
 b.Find Pid of product with highest price.
 c.Create method (with array of product’s object as argument) in ProductClient class to calculate and return total amount spent on all products. (amount spent on single product = price of product * quantity of product)

 9.Make list of Students having name,rollno.,age,score.
 Write a program to accept 10 students record and arrange the Students based on the score group [0-50],[50-65],[65-80],[80-100].

 Display student details in for each score group.

 10. Create class Tile to store the edge length of a square tile , and create another class Floor to store length and width of a rectangular floor.
 Add methods: 
totalTiles(Tile t) in Floor class with Tile as argument to calculate the whole number of tiles needed to cover the floor completely.









--------- Array:

 1.Program to show sum and average of 10 element array. Accept array elements from user.
 2.Sort a ten element array in descending order.
 3.Create a array of 17 elements in 5 rows. And calculate sum of all elements.
 4.Program to find multiplication of two 3X3 matrices.
 5. Program to print transpose of a matrix.




----- Inheritance , Runtime Polymorphism 

1. Create class OneBHK
 with instance variable roomArea , hallArea and price 
 a.Create default and parameterized constructor;
 b.Method show(): to print OneBHK data member information;
 c. Create another class TwoBHK which has all the properties and behaviour of OneBHK
 and a new instance variable room2Area.
 a.Create default and parameterized constructor;
 b.Method show(): to print all data member information;
 Write main function in another class(Say XYZ) and store three TwoBHK
 flat’s information and print information using show method.
 Also print total amount of allflats.
